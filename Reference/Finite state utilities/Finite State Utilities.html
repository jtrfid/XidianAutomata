<h1>Important note</h1>
Due to problems with GUT WWW servers, and due to GUT's planned switch
to another internet domain, this page has been moved to a new
location: <a href="http://www.jandaciuk.pl/fsa.html">http://www.jandaciuk.pl/fsa.html</a>. Note
that the software repository on an FTP server had to be moved as well,
as not only it will be affected by the domain switch (the current
domain will be abandoned!), but GUT's FTP server crew is unreliable
(they switched off the server for several month at the beginning of 2016).
<h1>Finite state utilities</h1>
This page describes two software packages and some accompanying files
available from
<a href="http://www.jandaciuk.pl/Software/Fsa/">http://www.jandaciuk.pl/Software/Fsa/

<h2>Available Packages</h2>
Both packages are written in C++, and they can be compiled with
g++. Problems may arise when compiling with different compilers due to
the use of templates that tend not to be implemented universally. Both
packages use compact dictionaries that are automata (of different forms)
An interface in elisp is provided for both of them. The interface worked
with emacs19, but it is highly unlikely that it will work with emacs20
or later (specially with mule).

</a><a name="FSApack">
</a><h3><a name="FSApack"></a><a href="http://www.jandaciuk.pl/Software/Fsa/fsa_current.tar.gz">
fsa</a> - finite state automata</h3>
Current version number: <b>0.51</b>. Man pages (except for fsa_synth)
in HTML format are also available as
<a href="http://www.jandaciuk.pl/Software/Fsa/fsa_html.tar.gz">one
file</a>. 
  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.jandaciuk.pl/Man/fsa_accent.1.html">fsa_accent</a> - restores
  diacritics. Useful for languages that have
  diacritics. Fast program. Very compact dictionaries made from simple
  word lists. Many different dictionaries may be used
  simultaneously. Optional emacs interface (based on ispell.el).

  </li><li><a href="http://www.jandaciuk.pl/Man/fsa_build.1.html">fsa_build</a> - builds various
  kinds of simple finite state automata. No regular expressions,
  tables, etc. Every line of input is treated as one word. This
  program requires the data to be lexicographically sorted and without
  duplicates.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.jandaciuk.pl/Man/fsa_build.1.html">fsa_ubuild</a> - does the same
  job as fsa_build, but more slowly and using more memory. However,
  the data need not be sorted, and it may contain duplicates.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.jandaciuk.pl/Man/fsa_guess.1.html">fsa_guess</a> - performs
  morphological analysis of both known and unknown words. The analysis
  for known words can be 100% correct, the unknown ones -
  approximative, based on suffixes and prefixes. The 
  dictionary is built from a morphological dictionary for a given
  language, so once such a dictionary is available, no special
  linguistic knowledge is required. There is also a mode for guessing
  morphological descriptions in mmorph (a morphology tool from <a href="http://www.issco.unige.ch/">ISSCO</a>) format. A <a href="http://www.pg.gda.pl/~jandac/tclmacq.html">Tcl/Tk
  interface</a> is provided that facilitates the task of adding new words
  to a dictionary. You must have a core description first, and then
  you can use the interface and fsa_guess to enlarge it.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.jandaciuk.pl/Man/fsa_hash.1.html">fsa_hash</a> - implements perfect
  hashing. Words in a sorted list of 
  words are numbered, and the program translates words to numbers, and
  numbers to words. This can be used e.g. in indexing encyclopaedias.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.jandaciuk.pl/Man/fsa_morph.1.html">fsa_morph</a> - performs
  morphological analysis of words, i.e. for a 
  given inflected form, it gives the corresponding lexeme and
  categories. Several dictionaries may be used at the same
  time. Dictionaries are compact, data for them has a very simple format
  (sample awk preparation scripts are present in the package), and the
  program is very fast. Emacs interface for text annotation provided in
  the package.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.jandaciuk.pl/Man/fsa_prefix.1.html">fsa_prefix</a> - prints all the
  entries of a dictionary that begin with a given prefix.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.jandaciuk.pl/Man/fsa_spell.1.html">fsa_spell</a> - spellchecks
  words. Special care is taken to treat 
  sequences of characters that are pronounced the same as if they were
  one character. This is important when looking for candidates for
  replacements in Polish. Otherwise a user might think the word is not
  in the dictionary, but it is correct.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.jandaciuk.pl/Man/fsa_synth.1.html">fsa_synth</a> - generates surface
  word forms given the canonical form and
  features/tags/annotations. The latter can be specified using regular
  expressions. Also, printing all surface forms for the given
  canonical form is possible.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.jandaciuk.pl/Man/fsa_visual.1.html">fsa_visual</a> - produces data
  for visualization of automata with <a href="http://www.cs.uni-sb.de/RW/users/sander/html/gsvcg1.html">vcg</a>
  - a graph visualization tool. Useful for diagnostic purposes.

  </li><li>There are also various scripts, mainly for converting data to
  appropriate formats, but also for other purposes, like a Tcl/Tk
  script that creates an interface for adding new words to a
  morphological dictionary.

utr</a> - transducers</h3>
Current version number: <b>0.10</b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>tr_accent</b> - restores diacritics. Useful for languages that have
  diacritics. Fast program, uses the same dictionaries as tr_spell and
  tr_morph. Several dictionaries may be used at the same time. Emacs
  interface provided (based on ispell.el).

  </li><li><b>tr_morph</b> - performs both morphological analysis and generation of
  inflected forms. Fast. Several dictionaries may be used at the same
  time. Dictionaries are the same as for tr_spell and tr_accent. Emacs
  interface facilitates annotation of corpora.

  </li><li><b>tr_prefix</b> - lists all dictionary entries that have surface forms
  beginning with a given string.

  </li><li><b>tr_spell</b> - spellchecks words. Fast. Uses the same dictionaries as
  tr_accent and tr_morph. Several dictionaries may be used at the same
  time. Special care is taken to treat sequences of characters that are
  pronounced the same as if they were one character. This is important
  when looking for candidates for replacements in Polish. Otherwise a
  user might think the word is not the dictionary, but it is correct.

  </li><li><b>tr_ubuild</b> - builds transducers for tr_accent, tr_morph, tr_prefix,
  and tr_spell. Transducers provide compact representation of
  morphological data.

To avoid confusion, I use some name extensions to indicate the contensts
of a dictionary:

  </dd><dt>atg</dt><dd>a list a tergo (i.e. inverted) of inflected forms with

  GUESS_LEXEMES or run with -a option. This is used to guess categories
  of words from their endings.

  </dd><dt>atl</dt><dd>a list a tergo (i.e. inverted) of inflected forms with
  lexemes and categories compiled to a simple automaton - to be used
  with fsa_guess compiled with GUESS_LEXEMES, but without GUESS_PREFIX,
  or with GUESS_PREFIX, but run with -p option. This is used to guess
  corresponding lexemes and categories from word endings.

  </dd><dt>atp</dt><dd>a list a tergo (i.e. inverted) of inflected forms with
  lexemes and categories compiled to a simple automaton - to be used
  with fsa_guess compiled with both GUESS_LEXEMES and GUESS_PREFIX. In
  this automaton prefixes are stored differently so that the automaton
  is smaller, and some more generalizations are possible. This is used
  to guess corresponding lexemes and categories from word endings and
  beginnings. 

  </dd><dt>tr</dt><dd>transducer - to be used with all programs that have names
  beginning with tr_.

<h3>Available dictionaries</h3>

Note that the dictionaries were constructed long time ago, and with
fsa_build that used only a format available at that time. To use the
default set of compile options for the current version, you have to
rebuild the automata.

  You can find his articles and some software

  </li><li>You can find the most sophisticated transducers at <a href="http://www.xrce.xerox.com/">Xerox</a>. Actually, I was inspired by a
  talk given by Lauri Karttunnen in <a href="http://latl.unige.ch/latl/archamps.html">Archamps</a>. They have
  <a href="http://www.xrce.xerox.com/publis/pubhome.html">a collection of
  articles</a>, and <a href="http://www.xrce.xerox.com/competencies/content-analysis/fst/home.en.html">a page
  dedicated to finite state automata</a> with a cool demo.</li>

  <li>There is <a href="http://grid.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/FSA/fsa.html">a
  very impressive page by Gertjan van Noord</a> describing a very
  impressive set of FSA utilities (with visualization tools). I do not
  use them, but they look far more sophisticated than mine. However,
  the functionality is different. Several articles on FSAs can be
  found there.</li>

  <li><a href="ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/techreports/pi/automata/">A
  collection of articles</a> by Bruce W. Watson describing various automaton
  minimization techniques and the FIRE Engine toolkit that implements
  them (also available by ftp). Again, I do not use these algorithms; my
  automata are minimized on-the-fly as they are created.<br>
  <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/fastar/main.php?button=supervisors">Bruce W. Watson</a> is now at the Eindhoven Technical University and at
  the University of Pretoria, South Africa. He used to have a web
  server with his publications and his software, but that address has
  been taken over by someone else. </li>

  <li><a href="http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~tomasz/">Tomasz
  Kowaltowski</a> and his team (Cláudio L.  Lucchesi and Jorge Stolfi)
  produce the smallest automata (measured in bytes). The small size
  is obtained by special coding on the bit level. From version 0.17 of
  the fsa package on, I use their compression of chains of states.</li>

  <li>Automata and transducers even more impressive (to me) than those by
  Xerox are used in the
  <a href="http://www.ladl.jussieu.fr/INTEX/">INTEX</a> project. The
  INTEX team also uses stack automata (capable of dealing with
  context-free grammars). I have seen the system in action, and I was
  amazed by the ease of use with which the user can enter new
  information into the system, and the variety of output it can
  produce. There is also a clone of INTEX - <a href="http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~unitex/">Unitex</a>. It works in
  Unicode, and unlike INTEX, it is available under GPL.</li>

  <li>You may want to read an <a href="http://www.jandaciuk.pl/incr_fst.ps.gz">article</a> I wrote with <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/fastar/main.php?button=supervisors">Bruce Watson</a> and Richard
  Watson on the construction of minimal deterministic acyclic
  finite-state automata. I use the algorithms in my programs.</li>

  <li>Stoyan Mihov independently invented my algorithm for sorted
  data. In his <a href="http://www.lml.bas.bg/~stoyan/publications.html">article</a>
  he gives a proof of a very interesting feature of that algorithm
  concerning its memory requirement. We prepared a joint <a href="http://www.jandaciuk.pl/daciuk98.ps.gz">publication</a> in Computational Linguistics 26(1), 2000,
  with Bruce and Richard and Stoyan (much revised version of the
  Ankara paper with many corrections, and with Stoyan's
  contribution).</li>

  <li>In general, you can look at my <a href="http://www.jandaciuk.pl/DaciukPublications.html">list of
