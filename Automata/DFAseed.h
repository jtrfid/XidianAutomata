Abstract states and the subset construction

An abstract state is a certain type of object used in the construction of a DFA. They are essentially
states in the subset construction (see [Wat93a, p. 12-13]) with some extra information.
The template function construct_components uses the extra information to construct a DFA. All
abstract states in FIRE engine are implemented using classes with names beginning with DS,
such as DSDFARev. An abstract state must have the following member functions:
	• an argumentless constructor, a copy constructor, an assignment operator, and equality and
	inequality operators;

	• final -- returns 1 if the abstract state is an accepting (final) state, 0 otherwise;

	• out_labels -- returns a CRSet representing the set of labels of out-transitions from the abstract
	state; and

	• out_transition -- takes a CharRange (which is an element ofthe CRSet returned by out_labels),
	and returns the abstract state resulting from a transition on the CharRange.

Description: Template function construct_components implements the subset construction, with
useless state removal [Wat93a, p. 12-13]. It takes an "abstract state" and constructs the
components of a DFA (using the abstract state argument as the start state), returning them
in a DFA_components structure. It does this by encoding the abstract states as States,
using a 【breadth-first traversal】 of the start-reachable abstract states. During the traversal,
the deterministic transition relation (a DTransRel) is also constructed. As a result of using
a traversal starting at the start state, only reachable States and the reachable part of the
deterministic transition relation are constructed.

Implementation: This template function should really appear as a template constructor of class
DFA. It is implemented separately, as template member functions have only recently been
incorporated into the draft of the C++ language standard. The function implements the
subset construction (see [Wat93a, pp. 12, 13]). Each abstract state is assigned a State,
using a StateTo to keep track of the names assigned. The out-transitions from each State
are constructed, using the StateTo to lookup the encoding of an abstract state. The abstract
state classes are to be written in such a way that there are only finitely many of them,
thereby ensuring termination of the function. The useless state removal is hidden in the fact
that, by starting with the start state, only reachable States are constructed.
