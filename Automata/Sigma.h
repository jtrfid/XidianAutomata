/************************************************************************************
 The Σ-algebra
	Template class Reg is used to define a client interface for the regular Σ-algebra (which is fully
	defined in [Wat93a, Section 3]). The template takes a single type parameter T which is used as
	the carrier set of the Σ-algebra. Class Reg<T> derives publicly from T, and so an Reg<T> can
	be used anywhere that a T can. The following member functions are provided:

	For any two carrier sets Tl and T2 , the Sigma-algebra operator definitions will have very little in
	common. For this reason, the operators of template class Reg are specially defined defined for
	each carrier set. Presently, the operators are only defined for three type parameters (carrier sets):
	Reg<RE>, Reg<FA>, and Reg<RFA>. (see files Sig-re.cpp, Sig-fa.cpp, and Sig-rfa.cpp).

Implementation class: Reg
Files: Sigma.h
Uses: CharRange, RE, REops

Description: Reg implements the Σ-algebra as defined in [Wat93a, Section 3]. The single type
(or generic) parameter T is used to specify the carrier set of the Σ-algebra. The template Reg
is an abstract template, in the sense that it is only used to force a common interface between
the Σ-algebras. Most of the member functions are left undefined, with versions specific to the
carrier set being defined separately (see files Sig-re.cpp, Sig-fa.cpp, and Sig-rfa.cpp).
Regular expressions (class RE) are taken as the Σ-term algebra. 
A special member function is defined, taking a regular expression, and constructing the homomorphic image of the RE,
in the Σ-algebra of T. The Σ-algebra is the only way to construct regular expressions, and
it is particularly useful for constructing parts of a finite automaton separately. 
Reg<T> inherits publicly from a T, and since a Reg<T> contains nothing extra, it can be cast to a T
safely (no slicing occurs, and no information is lost). 
Presently, only Reg<RE>, Reg<FA>,and Reg<RFA> are available. (Each of RE, FA, and RFA also have constructors taking
a const reference to RE; for practical purposes, these constructors are much faster than
constructing the homomorphic image using Reg.)

Implementation: The template is used to force a common interface for Σ-algebras with different
carrier sets. Forcing an interface is commonly done using abstract base classes, although
this is not possible in this case, as the return types of many of the member functions would
not be correct.

Performance: The homomorphic image member function is recursive, and keeps partially constructed
results in local variables. Use-counting in the carrier class can improve performance.
