$\textbf{the signatures of the transition relations:}$

$T \in P(Q \times V \times Q)$

$T \in V \to P(Q \times Q)$

$T \in Q\times Q \to P(V)$

$T \in Q \times V \to P(Q)$

$T \in Q \to P(V \times Q)$

for example, the function $T \in Q \to P(V \times Q)$ is defined as $T(p) = \{(a,q):(p,a,q) \in T\}$

\hfill

$\textbf{$\epsilon$-transition relation:}$

$E \in P(Q\times Q)$

$E \in Q \to P(Q)$

\hfill

$T \in P(Q \times V \times Q), T = \{(s,a,q) \}$

$T(s)\in Q \to P(V\times Q), T(s) = \{(a,q):(s,a,q) \in T\}$

$Q_{map}: P(Q\times V), Q_{map} = \{(q,a): (s,a,q) \in T\}$

$Q_{map}(q) = \{a: (s,a,q)\in T\}$

${Q_{map}}^{-1}: V \nrightarrow P(Q), {Q_{map}}^{-1} = \{(a,q): (s,a,q) \in T\}$

According to Convention A.4 (Tuple projection):

$\bar{\pi}_2(T) = \{(s,q): (s,a,q)\in T \}$

$Q_{map} = (\bar{\pi}_1(T))^R, Q_{map} = \{(a,q):(s,a,q) \in T\}^R = \{(q,a):(s,a,q) \in T\}$

\hfill

$f(a)=(f(a^R))^R$

\hfill

$\textbf{Prefix-closure:}$ Let $L\subseteq V^*$,then
$$\overline{L} := \{s\in V^*:(\exists t\in V^*)[st\in L]\}$$

In words, the prefix closure of L is the language denoted by $\overline{L}$ and consisting of all the prefixes in L. In general, $L\subseteq \overline{L}$.

L is said to be prefix-closed if $L = \overline{L}$. Thus language L is prefix-closed if any prefix of any string in L is also an element of L.

$L_1 = \{\epsilon,a,aa\}, L_1 = \overline{L_1}, L_{1}$ is prefix-closed.

$L_2 = \{a,b,ab\}, \overline{L_2} = \{\epsilon,a,b,ab\}, L_2 \subset \overline{L_2}, L_2$ is not prefix closed.

\hfill

$\textbf{Post-language:}$ Let $L\subseteq V^{\ast}$ and $s\in L$. Then the post-language of L after s, denoted by L/s, is the language 
$$ L/s := \{t\in V^{\ast}:st\in L\}$$
By definition, $L/s = \emptyset$ if $s \notin \overline{L}$.

\hfill

$\textbf{Definition A.15 (Left derivatives):}$ Given language $A\subseteq V^{\ast}$ and $w\in V^{\ast}$ we define the left derivative of A with respect to $w$ as:
$$w^{-1}A = \{x\in V^{\ast}:wx\in A\}$$
Sometimes derivatives are written as $D_{w}A$ or as $\frac{dA}{dw}$. Right derivatives are analogously defined. Derivatives can also be extended to $B^{-1}A$ where B is also a language.

\hfill

$\textbf{Kleene-closure:}$ Let $L\subseteq V^*$, then
$$L^* := \{\epsilon\}\cup L \cup LL\cup LLL\cup \cdots$$
This is the same operation that we defined above for the set V, except that now it is applied to set L whose elements may be strings of length greater than one. An element of $L^*$ is formed by the concatenation of a finite (but possibly arbitrarily large) number of elements of L; this includes the concatenation of "zero" elements, that is the empty string $\epsilon$. Note that $\ast$ operation is idempotent: ${(L^*)}^* = L^*$.
