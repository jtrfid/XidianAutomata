the signatures of the transition relations:

$T \in P(Q \times V \times Q)$

$T \in V \to P(Q \times Q)$

$T \in Q\times Q \to P(V)$

$T \in Q \times V \to P(Q)$

$T \in Q \to P(V \times Q)$
\\
$\epsilon$-transition relation:

$E \in P(Q\times Q)$

$E \in Q \to P(Q)$

for example, the fuction $T \in Q \to P(V \times Q)$ is defined as $T(p) = \{(a,q):(p,a,q) \in T\}$
